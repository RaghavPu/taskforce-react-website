I am currently working on making save slots for our game, basically the saving and loading system. I have created the User Interface for our game. This includes the minimap, the health bar, and the menus (the pause, main, and options menu). In addition to this I also made titles for overworld objects (images that appear on and around objects), and at the beginning of the year I also messed around with player death and respawn mechanics along with general player movement. To end off this project I plan on finishing up the save slots this sprint, and after that I want to go back and improve some code while also uniting my code with others in order to make the prototype. My hobbies include board games, puzzles, video games, running, and reading. I know how to program in c++, java, swift, and unreal.",

I planned and designed narrative choices, made diagrams showing dialogue, wrote drafts of scripts and story documents, worked on implementing a functional dialogue system to combine gameplay with the story, and worked on cutscenes to visually demonstrate the story as well. In addition, before the main project, I had played around with environments and set up scenes in the Unreal Engine. I personally believe that I am a better designer than I am a programmer. I can and have programmed for the past 5 years, but I enjoy making decisions about what I make more. Whether it be choosing how a game will look like or what the story is, I am more fascinated by building the idea of the game than putting it together (however I still like doing a little bit of both the best). I am planning on attending the University of North Texas to get a major in Computer Science with a certificate/specialization in Game Design. This will hopefully enable me to get an entry-level position at a game company as a programmer and work my way up to being a game designer, and possibly a leadership position in the design department. Alongside that, I am planning on working on an independent game in college. I already developed and published a game in high school and enjoyed the process so I figure I’ll do it again (if I’m not too busy at that time). Finally, in the long term, I would like to be a lead designer, a principal designer, or something similar at a company (maybe even have my own studio).",

Some of the things I hope to finish is polishing the ai’s cover system as sometimes the arms or head are still visible. Make a group retreat task, and a cover fire task.

This system can be applied to almost any object, and all of the aspects of a mission can be customized individually in a simple manner.

        "bio": "Game development has taken multiple strides from its origins, from improving graphics, performance and design to improving the level of complexity. As a result, one of these fundamental aspects that can be found in most games nowadays is how sound behaves within the game’s environment. As a result, I have devoted time into researching how sound behaves and is implemented specifically into Unreal Engine, but what I have learned can easily be translated towards anything else that requires my skills and expertise. From what I had gathered, some of the basic ways sound can behave are categorized under the following: Attenuation, Occlusion, The Doppler Effect and Reverb. Attenuation is in relation to how sound behaves depending on distance from the source while also carrying data about where the sound originates from. This means the farther you move from the source, the lower the gain the sound outputs as well as having respective levels of gain based on direction. Directional sound can be replicated in a many number of ways, it ultimately depends on how the user wants the sound to behave. Occlusion is in relation to how sound behaves when interacting with an object, also known as muffling. Many factors have to be considered when replicating occlusion within a game environment, such as wall thickness, material, shape and location. For example, if sound is emanating through the wall of a house, the sound should sound muffled, but also be intelligible on the other side, meaning the thickness is quite thin and the material variable should also have a low value. Now, for The Doppler Effect, this is in relation to how sound behaves when the source is in motion relative to the player’s location. This can be witnessed everywhere, from cars driving on a street to planes flying overhead, where the sounds created by those vehicles seem to be changing as it moves, when in reality the sound being emanated hasn’t changed in nature. Multiple approaches can be used to replicate this effect, but for the most part it follows the route of altering the sound’s pitch relative to the distance it has from the player. Lastly, the final thing I've worked on so far is Convolution Reverb. Convolution reverb is in relation to how sound behaves depending on room size. Convolution reverb is recreated in game by reading an impulse response, a sound that is recorded in a set room, in order to imitate the way sound behaves in the recording. By adding reverb to this effect, one can achieve a hyper realistic ambience, which is best used for large rooms or caves. I plan on implementing these sound systems into games in order to capture a realistic ambience within games. Additionally I plan on expanding on these sound systems, such as using attenuation and occlusion in combination with dialogue to create realistic npcs. My goals are to attend a good university in order to further sharpen my skills, and hopefully expand my career into the video game industry.",

During my time in Bakerland labs this year, my primary focus has been to lead our team’s source control operations. As a student, I put together tutorials and training sessions for our group to affiliate them with Git and version control techniques. Additionally, I spent a considerable amount of research time implementing our Unreal Blueprints programming ecosystem with Github, which is better resourced for text-based programming languages (i.e. Java, C, Python). Now, I am also working with the website development team to build a React website for our game development studio to bring the idea of our game out to the general public. In the future, I will be attending the University of California at Berkeley as an Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences major within the school of engineering. At this program, I hope to utilize its prestigious academic and networking resources to build my career in computer science and work towards possibly running my own software start-up in the future.",
